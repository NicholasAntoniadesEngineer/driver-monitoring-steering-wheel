# ECG Driver Monitoring Steering Wheel (2022)

## Overview
As part of an Innovate UK funded project (May 2021), this project explores the feasibility of recording heart rate variability (HRV) data of a driver in a vehicle using bipotential recording directly from the steering wheel. The system faces unique challenges in dealing with electromagnetic interference, noise management, and signal consistency as drivers move their hands along and occasionally off the steering wheel.

The videos folder contains demonstrations of the concept working.

## Project Goals
- Research and analyze vehicle ambient and driver-movement noise within the expected application setting
- Develop a proof-of-concept demonstrator comprising:
  - Multiple steering wheel cover versions with different electrode technologies
  - Simple steering wheel test rig for tabletop placement
  - Biopotential capture electronics with user display
  - R-peak extraction and HRV calculation capabilities
